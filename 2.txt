Say you roll three dice, one by one. What is the probability that you obtain 3 numbers in a strictly increasing order?

This problem was asked by Uber.

First note that the three rolls must all be different numbers otherwise there isn't a strictly increasing order. 
The probability that the 3 numbers will be different is given by:

1âˆ— 5/6 * 4/6 = 5/6

Conditioned on there being three different numbers, there is exactly one particular sequence that will be in a strictly increasing order, 
which occurs with probability 1/3! = 1/6.

Therefore the desired probability is given by:

5/9 * 1/6 = 5/54
