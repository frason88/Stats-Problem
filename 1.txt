How would you improve product engagement on Twitter?


I will define user engagement as the percentage of users who log in and use one Twitter feature per day.
Then, explain which variables you think may be important in that metric. 
This can be user characteristics like age, gender, and country or it can be related to their online behavior such as their device type, mobile vs web, session time.
Based on what you chose, pick a model to predict the metric from the first using variables from the second. Emphasize why you picked that model. 
For example, SVMs work well for high dimensionality, whereas tree-based classifiers are more interpretable. Assuming the model is trained and makes 
good predictions, with features that make intuitive sense, you want to push features that will improve the desired metrics (while holding all else roughly equal). 
These can be evaluated in a traditional A/B testing setup. Lastly, define the next steps and potential actions based on the results of the testing.
