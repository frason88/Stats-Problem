This problem was asked by Twitter.

Assume you are given the below tables for the session activity of users. 
Write a query to assign ranks to users by the total session duration for the different session types they have had between a start date (2020-01-01) and an end date (2020-02-01).

Sessions
-------------------------
column_name	   | type   |
session_id	   |integer |
user_id	       |integer |
session_type	 |string  |
duration	     |integer |
start_time	   |datetime|
------------------------|

Solution:
 First, we can do a subquery to get the total session duration by user and session type between the start and end date. 
 Then, we can use RANK() to get the rank, where we make sure to partition by session type and then order by duration:
 WITH user_duration AS (
     SELECT user_id, session_type, SUM(duration) AS duration
       FROM sessions
       WHERE start_time >= '2020-01-01' AND start_time <= '2020-02-01'
     GROUP BY 1, 2)
     
      SELECT user_id,
           session_type,
           RANK() OVER (partition by session_type ORDER BY duration DESC) AS rank
           FROM user_duration
